# HI! My name is Mike

### A little description about myself:
I'm a german teenager who's been coding for around 2 years but I still consider myself a beginner.  
I have been using linux exclusively for around 3 years. (I'm into ricing as well so I might post dotfiles in the future)  
I really like doing everything on the command line and I've been only making projects for CLI.   
*Most of the stuff I write are for personal use and thus rather awful but you're welcome to use them.*

### What languages do I work in?
I've been using Javascript for web-dev in the past but I've stopped completely and I don't think I'll use it anywhere else than a personal website.  
Since then I've been picking up C over the last few months and I have a few more I want to learn.  
Namely:  
- [ ] Go
- [ ] C++
- [ ] Rust ?

### Currently I have ...
- ...started work on a small CLI password manager in C (currently still privated)  
- ...plans for a CLI learning program
